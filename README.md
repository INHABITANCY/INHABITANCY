I'M AWARE THAT MY ICON'S ARTIST IS PROBLEMATIC. GEEENUINELY DON'T GIVE A FUCK, I'M 'PROBLEMATIC' MYSELF BY VIRTUE OF BEING A HABIT. I DON'T HAVE TO LIKE SOMEONE OR AGREE WITH THEM TO LIKE THEIR ART. OKAY? OKAY.  

## I'M A SUBSYSTEM OF MALICITORS. DON'T EXPECT ME TO ADHERE TO YOUR MORALS.  
## I'M A NASTY THING. I SAY AND DO NASTY THINGS.  
  
THIS THING'S A BIG WIP, EXERCISE PATIENCE
